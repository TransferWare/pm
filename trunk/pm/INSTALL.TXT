Full installation instructions can be found in doc/pm-manual.rtf. This
is just a quick start guide.

The command line is used for all commands. Commands start with a prompt
("$" for the shell command line and "SQL>" for SQL*Plus).  Variables
are between "<" and ">".

1) Create an application owner

   The preferred application owner name is PM_OWNER. When Oracle
   Application Express (Apex) is used for reporting, one must use the
   Apex database as the Performance Monitor repository database.

   a) Change to the admin directory below pm home:

      $ cd <pm home>/admin

   b) Start SQL*Plus without logging on:

      $ sqlplus /nolog

   c) Enter the following SQL*Plus commands:

      SQL> connect sys@<repository database> as sysdba
      SQL> @ creusr <application owner> <default tablespace> <temporary tablespace>
      SQL> @ pm.grt <application owner>
      SQL> exit

   d) Change to the db directory below pm home:

      $ cd <pm home>/db

   e) Start SQL*Plus (or SQLcl) as the application owner:

       $ sqlplus <application owner>@<repository database>

			 or:

       $ sql <application owner>@<repository database>

   f) Enter the following SQL*Plus commands (defaults between "[" and "]"):

      SQL> @ PM_OWNER/src/full/install.sql
      SQL> exit

      There should be no (Oracle) errors.

   g) When you want to use Apex:

      $ cd <pm home>/apex/src/export
			
      SQL> @ install.sql

2) Installation of database links

   The Performance Monitor can monitor remote databases using database links.

   a) Change to the admin directory:

      $ cd <pm home>/admin

   b) start SQL*Plus without logging on:

      $ sqlplus /nolog

   c) Create a database link account (on a remote database):

      The preferred database link account name is PM_LINK.

      SQL> connect sys@<database to monitor> as sysdba
      SQL> @ creusr <database link account> <default tablespace> <temporary tablespace>
      SQL> @ pm_remote.grt <database link account>
      SQL> connect <database link account>@<database to monitor>
      SQL> @ pm_remote.sql

   d) Create a database link (on the repository database)

      SQL> connect <application owner>@<repository database>
      SQL> @ credblnk <database link> <database link account> <database link account password> <tns service>

      Test the link by:

      SQL> select * from global_name@<database link>;

3) Collect information

   Collect information for database denoted by database link MYDB:

   SQL> execute pm.collect('MYDB')

   or collect information about the current database by:

   SQL> execute pm.collect(NULL)

   or even shorter:

   SQL> execute pm.collect

4) Cleanup

   Clean up 14 days of history for database MYDB:

   SQL> execute pm.cleanup('MYDB', 14)

   or clean up for the current database:

   SQL> execute pm.cleanup(NULL, 14)
